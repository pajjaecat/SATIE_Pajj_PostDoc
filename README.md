## What it is 
### A repository that contains my post-Doc Work
All the code presented here is written in [python](https://www.python.org/), making use of the powerful [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). A list of the library and packages needed to run the notebooks and modules is availble in [package-list](package-list.txt).
