## What it is 
### A repository that contains my post-Doc Work
All the code presented here is written in python, making use of the powerful [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). A list of the library and packages needed to run the notebooks and modules is availble in [package-list](package-list.txt)

In development ...

## Architecture
The repository is subdivided in 3 subfolders as follows:  
- [Notebooks](Notebooks/): Contains all the notebooks and examples of usage of the function defined in the modules. See [NotebooksReadMe](Notebooks/README.md) for a brief description of each notebook;
- [Modules](Modules/): Contains different modules which themselves contains functions. See [ModulesReadMe](Modules/README.md) for more details;
- [DataFiles](DataFiles/): Contains the files/dataset associated with the notebooks or results of simulation that can be recall for easy use. See [DataReadME](DataFiles/README.md) for more details; 


## TODO
- [x] Update dataset location in all the notebooks
- [x] Add readMe in each SubFolder
- [x] Create link between readMe and notebooks
- [ ] Create link between readMe and modules (Is it doable? )
- [ ] Add MPC folder
- [ ] Create a module for functions used in [MSAR_SolarMeanPred](Notebooks/MSAR_SolarMeanPred.ipynb) and related
